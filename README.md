Using the famous dasatest of mtcats, I provide explorations of three important supervised machine learning 
regressions of Lasso, Ridge, stepLR regressions using the MTCars dataset.

I'm testing which model performs the best using the training and testing data. My suggestion is that
the ideal model would be Step-wise backward regression since training has an r-squared of 0.9 and testing
has an r-squared of 0.857 with a relatively small measure of error.
